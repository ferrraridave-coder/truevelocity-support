<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is True Velocity?</h3>
<p>
    True Velocity is a precision GPS speedometer for iPhone. It displays both an analogue dial
    and a large digital speed readout in real time using your device’s built-in GPS.
</p>

<h3>Does the app track or store my location?</h3>
<p>
    No. True Velocity uses your device’s GPS solely to calculate your current speed.
    Location data is processed on your device and is not stored, transmitted, or shared.
    The app does not create route history or movement logs.
</p>

<h3>Why does the app show GPS accuracy in metres?</h3>
<p>
    GPS accuracy can vary depending on signal strength, surroundings, and satellite visibility.
    True Velocity displays the current horizontal accuracy (in metres) so you can see how precise
    the GPS signal is. Lower numbers indicate better accuracy.
</p>

<h3>What happens if GPS signal is weak?</h3>
<p>
    If the app cannot obtain a reliable GPS signal, a low accuracy warning is shown.
    Speed readings may be delayed or less precise until signal quality improves.
</p>

<h3>How do I change between MPH and KMH?</h3>
<p>
    Tap the settings button in the bottom-right corner of the screen.
    Under <strong>Units</strong>, select either MPH or KMH.
</p>

<h3>What is Speed Response?</h3>
<p>
    Speed Response adjusts how quickly the dial reacts to speed changes.
    <strong>Smooth</strong> provides more filtering,
    <strong>Balanced</strong> offers a middle ground,
    and <strong>Fast</strong> prioritises responsiveness.
</p>

<h3>What is Adaptive Filtering?</h3>
<p>
    Adaptive Filtering dynamically adjusts smoothing based on signal quality and movement,
    helping to reduce jitter while maintaining responsiveness.
</p>

<h3>Is an account required?</h3>
<p>
    No account is required. True Velocity works entirely on your device.
</p>

<h3>Does the app work offline?</h3>
<p>
    Yes. True Velocity does not require an internet connection.
    However, GPS signal quality may be affected by indoor environments or signal obstruction.
</p>

<h3>How does the trial and purchase work?</h3>
<p>
    True Velocity includes a seven-day trial period.
    After the trial ends, a one-time purchase is required to continue using the app.
    Payments are processed securely by Apple through In-App Purchase.
    The developer does not receive your payment details.
</p>

<h3>What devices are supported?</h3>
<p>
    True Velocity supports iPhone running iOS 18.0 or later.
</p>

<h3>How do I report a bug?</h3>
